Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Retail Sales Data
  In this project, I worked with a dataset (retail_sales_dataset.csv) containing information about retail sales. I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) 
to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help the retail business make informed decisions. The visualizations generated during the analysis are 
provided in the visualizations folder, and (Actionable Recommendations Based on EDA.docx) is a report to guide strategic business actions.

Cleaning Data
  In this project, I worked with an unclean dataset (AB_NYC-2019.CSV) and transformed it into a cleaned dataset (cleaned_airbnb_data.csv) through a structured 
cleaning process. 

This process involved:
Data Integration
Handling Missing Data
Duplicate Removal
Standardization
Outlier Detection
This cleaned dataset is ready for further analysis or modeling.

House Price Prediction
  This project involves predicting house prices using a Linear Regression model based on relevant features from the dataset (Housing.csv). The predictions are 
visualized in visualization.png, which shows the relationship between actual and predicted house prices, highlighting the model's performance.
